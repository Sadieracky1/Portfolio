    <p>These projects range from hardware sound circuitry, object oriented programming, audio programming/live coding, and website hardcoding. These are only a few examples of the different experience I have with different technology mediums. I am currently working on building a analog modular synth and other software related games. These will be added as they are completed.  </p>

      <h3>LM386 Amplifier</h3>
<p>The LM386 is a versatile and easy-to-use Class-AB audio power amplifier IC designed for low-voltage, battery-powered consumer applications like radio and portable stereo systems. It features an internally set voltage gain of 20, which can be increased to 200 with an external capacitor and resistor, requires minimal external components, and has a wide operating voltage range from 4V to 18V.</p>

      <h3>40106 Phase Shift Oscillator </h3>
<p>A phase-shift oscillator is a linear electronic oscillator circuit that produces a sine wave output. It consists of an inverting amplifier element such as a transistor or op amp with its output fed back to its input through a phase-shift network consisting of resistors and capacitors in a ladder network. The feedback network 'shifts' the phase of the amplifier output by 180 degrees at the oscillation frequency to give positive feedback.</p>

      <h3>Triple Vibrati Atari Punk Console</h3>
      <p>
The Triple Vibrati Punk Console is a DIY electronic instrument combining a low-frequency oscillator and an Atari Punk Console-style sound generator to create rich, dynamic sound effects. Using 555 and 556 timer chips, it produces modulated square-wave tones, with three knobs for adjusting pitch and tone.As well as one volume knob separate from those three. The LFO feeds into the sound generator, altering its base frequency for pulsating and warble sound effects.

      <h3>Twin-T Oscillator</h3>
      <p>A twin-T oscillator is an RC oscillator that produces a low-distortion sinusoidal output by using an active op-amp to provide positive feedback through a twin-T notch filter. The twin-T filter, a combination of parallel low-pass and high-pass RC networks, creates a null at a specific notch frequency. When placed in the feedback path of an amplifier, this network causes the circuit to oscillate at the notch frequency.  </p>

      <h3>Website: Website Development Club</h3>
<p>I created a fully hand-coded website for my college’s Website Development Club using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features a clean, responsive layout that works smoothly on both desktop and mobile screens, presenting the club’s mission, events, and member projects in an organized way. I used semantic HTML for clear structure, CSS for a cohesive visual design with custom colors and grid layouts, and JavaScript to add interactive elements like dynamic event updates, form validation, and subtle animations. This project showcases my ability to design and build a professional, accessible web experience from the ground up without relying on external frameworks.</p>

      <h3>Supercollider Synth</h3>
<p>I developed a SuperCollider live coding synth featuring 10 fully hand-coded synthesizers, designed to perform an entire live coding composition from scratch. Each synth was carefully programmed to produce unique textures, tones, and rhythms, allowing for intricate layering and dynamic interplay during performance. The project emphasizes real-time manipulation, expressive control, and algorithmic composition, demonstrating both sound design expertise and live coding proficiency. This setup showcases my ability to create a complete, self-contained musical performance environment using SuperCollider without relying on pre-made patches or samples.</p>

      <h3>MaxMSP Project</h3>
   <P>ChatGPT said:

I created a voice-controlled drum kit using node-based coding in Max/MSP, allowing my voice to trigger and manipulate percussion sounds in real time. By mapping different vocal pitches and amplitudes to individual drum elements, I was able to perform complex rhythmic patterns entirely through vocal input. The project explores the intersection of human expression and digital sound, showcasing my skills in interactive sound design, signal processing, and creative use of Max/MSP’s visual programming environment.</P>

      <h3>C# Text Based Game</h3>
<p>I developed a text-based game entirely from scratch using object-oriented programming in C#, implementing classes, objects, and methods to manage game logic, character stats, and interactions. The game features dynamic decision-making, inventory management, and randomized events, creating an engaging player experience purely through text. This project highlights my ability to design structured, modular code, handle complex program flow, and apply core OOP principles to build a fully functional interactive application without relying on external libraries or engines.</p>
